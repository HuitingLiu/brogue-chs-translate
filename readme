Be sure to read readme.rtf too.  This readme only explains functionality that
is specific to the Linux release of Brogue.

---

Brogue now supports remapped keys.  The remapping engine is quite limited
and is described in res/keymap.

Press F12 or alt-enter to toggle fullscreen mode.

./brogue is a shell script that will invoke brogue with the
appropriate switches and in the correct working folder.  It therefore
serves as an acceptable target for a desktop shortcut (see
make-link-for-desktop.sh for an easy way to make one.)  It will pass
command line arguments along to brogue.  The following switches are
accepted:

-h                         print a help message
-V                         print the version
--scores                   dump scores to output and exit immediately

-n                         start a new game, skipping the menu
-s seed                    start a new game with the specified numerical seed
-o filename[.broguesave]   open a recording (extension may be omitted)
-v recording[.broguerec]   view a recording (extension may be omitted)
-M                         same as --no-menu

--size N                   starts the game with font size N (1 to 13)
--no-menu                  never display the menu (automatically pick new game)
--noteye-hack              ignore SDL-specific application state checks
